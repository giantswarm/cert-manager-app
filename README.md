# cert-manager-app

Helm chart for the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) app running in Giant Swarm clusters.

cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers (e.g. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/) (ACME)) as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app.git
$ cd cert-manager-app
$ helm install helm/cert-manager-app
```

Provide a custom `values.yaml`:

```bash
$ helm install cert-manager-app -f values.yaml
```

Deployment to Workload Clusters is handled by [app-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-operator).

## Configuration

Configuration options are documented in [Configuration.md](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/blob/master/helm/cert-manager-app/Configuration.md) document.

## Upgrading

Before upgrading, please check [upgrading.md](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/blob/master/docs/upgrading.md).

## Release Process

* Ensure CHANGELOG.md is up to date.
* Create a new branch with name `master#release#vX.X.X`. Automation will create a release PR.
* Merging the release PR will push a new git tag and trigger a new tarball to be pushed to the
  [giantswarm-catalog].
* Test and verify the cert-manager release across supported environments in a new or existing WIP platform release.
