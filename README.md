# cert-manager-app

Helm chart for the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) app running in Giant Swarm clusters.

cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers (e.g. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/) (ACME)) as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.

## Installing

There are 3 ways to install this app onto a workload cluster.

1. [Using our web interface](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/web/app-platform/#installing-an-app)
2. [Using our API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/api/#operation/createClusterAppV5)
3. Directly creating the [App custom resource](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/management-api/crd/apps.application.giantswarm.io/) on the management cluster.

### Sample App CR for the Management Cluster

If you have access to the Kubernetes API on the management cluster, you can create the App CR directly.

Here is an example that would install the cert-manager-app to workload cluster `abc12`:

```
# appCR.yaml
apiVersion: application.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1
kind: App
metadata:

  # workload cluster resources live in a namespace with the same ID as the workload cluster.
  name: cert-manager-app
  namespace: abc12
spec:
  catalog: giantswarm
  kubeConfig:
    inCluster: false
  name: cert-manager-app
  namespace: my-org
  version: 2.20.0
```

If you called this file `appCR.yaml`, you can use the command: `kubectl apply -f appCR.yaml` to deploy this app to a workload cluster with the ID `abc12`.

## Configuration

Configuration options are documented in [Configuration.md](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/blob/master/helm/cert-manager-app/Configuration.md) document.

## Upgrading

Before upgrading, please check [upgrading.md](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/blob/master/docs/upgrading.md).

## For Developers

### Installing the Chart Locally

To install the chart locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app.git
$ cd cert-manager-app
$ helm install helm/cert-manager-app
```

Provide a custom `values.yaml`:

```bash
$ helm install cert-manager-app -f values.yaml
```

Deployment to Workload Clusters is handled by [app-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-operator).

### Release Process

* Ensure CHANGELOG.md is up to date.
* Create a new branch to trigger the release workflow as either a patch, minor, or major. E.g. to release a patch, create a branch from master called release#patch and push it. Automation will create a release PR.
* Merging the release PR will push a new git tag and trigger a new tarball to be pushed to the
  [giantswarm-catalog].
* Test and verify the cert-manager release across supported environments in a new or existing WIP platform release.
